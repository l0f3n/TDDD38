a)

When we multiple the values in the end we turn a 1-dimensional array into 0 dimensions (a single value).
This is exactly what reduce and accumulate does.
Reduce is faster as I understand, because it doesn't need to do it in order and multiplication commutes.

We rotate the values in the denominator to line them up with the ones in factor, which the function (so aptly named) rotate does.
